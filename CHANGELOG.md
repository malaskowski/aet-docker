# 1.1.0
This release fixes security issue, upgrading Browsermob and Karaf dependencies to log4j 2.17.1 fixing CVE-2021-44832 and other Log4jShell vulnerabilies.
If you migrate from version older than `1.0.0`, please remember to execute all steps in _upgrade notes_ for all the version between this and your current version.

# 1.0.0
### Images moved to my new Docker Hub space: https://hub.docker.com/u/malaskowski
This means you need to update both image name and tag in you AET instance cluster to be able to fetch the latest version of AET Docker images (rename `skejven/aet_XXX:0.14.0` to `malaskowski/aet_XXX:1.0.0`).

- [PR-28](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/28) - Before the start of a Karaf service, Docker secrets are exported to environment variables.
- Base images updates:
    - `aet_client` image base updated to `alpine:3.14`
    - `aet_report` image base updated to `httpd:2.4.48-alpine`

# 0.14.0
- [PR-27](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/27) - Karaf provisioned with all dependencies - offline mode provisioning support.
- [PR-26](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/26) - AET Docker client for running AET suites with no dependencies but Docker
- [PR-22](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/22) - changed no of Selenium Grid Nodes replicas in order to improve tests results stability.
- [PR-23](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/23) - updated mongodb image version to `3.6`. **Important**: if you are upgrading AET from the version that used mongo 3.2, please read carefully upgrade notes before migrating. Updated docker swarm schema to `3.7`.

#### Upgrade notes
0. Backup your data!
1. Upgrade to mongo image `3.4` first (set `image: mongo:3.4` in aet-swarm.yml and deploy - `docker stack deploy -c aet-swarm.yml aet`). Wait until AET stack will be up.
2. Assuming you have open port `27017` for mongo run: 
    ```
    docker exec -it `docker ps --filter expose=27017/tcp -q` bash -c 'mongo --eval "db.adminCommand( { getParameter: 1, featureCompatibilityVersion: 1 } )"'
    ```
    This should say `{ "featureCompatibilityVersion" : "3.2", "ok" : 1 }`.
    
3. Set `setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` flag to `3.4` (read more in [MongoDB upgrade notes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-upgrade-standalone/#prerequisites)), run:
    ```
    docker exec -it `docker ps --filter expose=27017/tcp -q` bash -c 'mongo --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"3.4\" } )"'
    ```
    You should see:
    `{ "ok" : 1 }`
    
4. Upgrade to mongo image `3.6` (set `image: mongo:3.6` in aet-swarm.yml and deploy - `docker stack deploy -c aet-swarm.yml aet`). Wait until AET stack will be up. 
5. Set `setFeatureCompatibilityVersion` flag to `3.6` (read more in [MongoDB upgrade notes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/3.6-upgrade-standalone/#prerequisites)), run:
    ```
    docker exec -it `docker ps --filter expose=27017/tcp -q` bash -c 'mongo --eval "db.adminCommand( { setFeatureCompatibilityVersion: \"3.6\" } )"'
    ```
    You should see:
    `{ "ok" : 1 }`
    
6. You are good to go :).

# 0.13.1
- [PR-21](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/21) Proxy all API endpoints via report app: /api, /suite, /xunit
Upgrade notes:
#### Upgrade notes
If you were using `AET_WEB_API` env for the `aet-report` service, please note, that it now points to the Karaf instance, not directly to the `/api` endpoint.
Simply remove `/api` from `AET_WEB_API` env property value.

# 0.13.0
- [PR-20](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/20) - `core` and `custom` AET artifacts in the Karaf image and healthcheck basing on the [fabric8 healthchecks](https://fabric8.io/guide/karaf.html#add-custom-heath-checks).

# 0.12.2

# 0.12.1
- [PR-17](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/17) Update maven repositories to use https over http. Fixes '501-https-required' error while downloading karaf dependecies. More info about the issue [here](https://support.sonatype.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041287334).

# 0.12.0

# 0.10.0
- [Support for AET application developers](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/10)

## Upgrade notes
All Karaf AET artifacts (`bundles`, `features` and `configs`) are now stored in the Karaf Container in
the `/aet` location:
```
├── aet
│   ├── bundles
│   ├── configs
│   └── features
```
The main change concerns `configs` which were previously stored directly under root `/configs` inside
the Karaf container. Remember to adjust your instance deployment config to that change.

# 0.9.0
- [Fixed](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/commit/881f0ac6c7e115ca3d1c830f76384a586a1cb660) ActiveMQ not working jmx interface
- AET Version upgraded to [`3.2.1`](https://github.com/Cognifide/aet/releases/tag/3.2.1) release
- AET artifacts are no longer stored in the repo but downloaded
- Important change: since [AET-463](https://github.com/Cognifide/aet/pull/463) there are one less bundles.
That caused:
  - `aet_karaf` provision healthcheck looks for `187` instead of `188` bundles active
  - healthcheck for the `karaf` container looks for `203` active bundles instead of `204`

# 0.8.0
- AET Version upgraded to [`3.2.0`](https://github.com/Cognifide/aet/releases/tag/3.2.0) release
- AET OSGi configs managed by mounted config volume in the stack file
- `example-aet-swarm` module with example cluster setup and configs

### how to migrate to 0.8.0 from 0.7.1
Because of [PR-6](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/pull/6) now OSGI configs are mounted as separate
volume for Karaf image. If you upgrade your AET instance from the previous version please do following steps:
1. As usual, update images version in your `aet-swarm.yml` file (to `0.8.0`).
2. Add `volumes` section to the `karaf` service with following volume definition:
```
    volumes:
      - ./configs:/configsp
```
  - See [example swarm config file](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/blob/master/example-aet-swarm/aet-swarm.yml#L105)
for the reference.
3. Download `example-aet-swarm.zip` from the [release](https://github.com/Skejven/aet-docker/releases/tag/0.8.0)
and unzip it. Copy `configs` folder to the same place, where you placed `aet-swarm.yml`.
4. Remove `environment` section from the `karaf` service. You may now configure `REPORT_DOMAIN` and 
`REPORT_DOMAIN` OSGi configs in the `configs` directory.
5. As usual run `docker stack deploy -c aet-swarm.yml aet` to update your AET stack.

    HEALTHCHECK --interval=1m --timeout=10s --start-period=120s \
       CMD curl -v --silent http://karaf:karaf@localhost:8181/system/console/bundles 2>&1 | grep -Fq ${HEALTHCHECK_PHRASE} || exit 1

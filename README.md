</p>

This repository contains Dockerfiles of AET images and example Docker Swarm manifest that enables setting up simple AET instance.
You may find released versions of AET Docker images at [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/malaskowski/). 
## Try AET
Following section describes how to run AET using Docker Swarm. Alternative to this is installing AET using Helm. See [AET Helm chart](https://github.com/malaskowski/aet-helm) repository for more deails.

### Run local instance using Docker Swarm
Make sure you have running Docker Swarm instance that has at least **`4 vCPU` and `8 GB of memory` available**. Read more in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

Follow these instructions to set up local AET instance:
1. Download the latest [`example-aet-swarm.zip`](https://github.com/malaskowski/aet-docker/releases/latest/download/example-aet-swarm.zip) and unzip the files to the folder from where docker stack will be deployed (from now on we will call it `AET_ROOT`).

<details><summary>See details</summary>
<p>

> You may run following script to automate this step:
> ```bash
> curl -sS `curl -Ls -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://github.com/malaskowski/aet-docker/releases/latest/download/example-aet-swarm.zip` > aet-swarm.zip \
> && unzip -q aet-swarm.zip && mv example-aet-swarm/* . \
> && rm -d example-aet-swarm && rm aet-swarm.zip
> ```
> 
> Contents of the `AET_ROOT` directory should look like:
> ```
> ├── aet-swarm.yml
> ├── bundles
> │   └── aet-lighthouse-extension.jar
> ├── configs
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.cleaner.CleanerScheduler-main.cfg
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.proxy.RestProxyManager.cfg
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.queues.DefaultJmsConnection.cfg
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.rest.helpers.ReportConfigurationManager.cfg
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.runner.MessagesManager.cfg
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.runner.RunnerConfiguration.cfg
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.vs.mongodb.MongoDBClient.cfg
> │   ├── com.cognifide.aet.worker.drivers.chrome.ChromeWebDriverFactory.cfg
> │   └── com.cognifide.aet.worker.listeners.WorkersListenersService.cfg
> ├── features
> │   └── healthcheck-features.xml
> ├── secrets
> │   └── KARAF_EXAMPLE_SECRET
> └── report
> ```
>   - If you are using docker-machine (otherwise ignore this point)
>    you should change `aet-swarm.yml` `volumes` section for the `karaf` service to:
>     ```yaml
>         volumes:
>           - /osgi-configs/configs:/aet/configs # when using docker-machine, use mounted folder
>     ```
> 
> You can find older versions in the [release](https://github.com/malaskowski/aet-docker/releases) section.

</p>
</details>

2. From the `AET_ROOT` run `docker stack deploy -c aet-swarm.yml aet`.
3. Wait about 1-2 minutes until instance is ready to work.

> Note, that you can always stop the instance by running 'docker stack rm aet' without loosing the data (volumes).

<details><summary>See details</summary>
<p>

> When it is ready, you should see the `HEALTHY` information in the [Karaf health check](http://localhost:8181/health-check) 
>  
> You may also check the status of Karaf by executing
>  
> ```bash
> docker ps --format "table {{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}" --filter expose=8181/tcp
> ```
>  
> When you see status `healthy` it means Karaf is running correctly
> 
> ```
> IMAGE                     STATUS
> malaskowski/aet_karaf:0.14.0   Up 3 minutes (healthy)
> ```

</p>
</details>

### Run sample suite
Simply run:
```
docker run --rm malaskowski/aet_client
```

You should see similar output:
```
Suite started with correlation id: example-example-example-1611937786395
[16:29:46.578]: COMPARED: [success:   0, total:   0] ::: COLLECTED: [success:   0, total:   1]
Suite processing finished
Report url:
http://localhost/report.html?company=example&project=example&correlationId=example-example-example-1611937786395
```

Open the url which will show your first AET report! Find more about the report in the [AET Docs](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/SuiteReport).

Read more on how to run your custom suite in the [Running AET Suite](#running-aet-suite) section.

## Docker Images

### AET ActiveMq
Hosts [Apache ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org/) that is used as the communication bus by the AET components.
### AET Browsermob
Hosts BrowserMob proxy that is used by AET to collect status codes and inject headers to requests.
### AET Karaf
Hosts [Apache Karaf](https://karaf.apache.org/) OSGi applications container.
It contains all AET modules (bundles): Runner, Workers, Web-API, Datastorage, Executor, Cleaner and runs them within OSGi context
with all their dependencies required (no internet access required to provision).
[AET application core](https://github.com/wttech/aet) is located in the `/aet/core` directory.
All custom AET extensions are kept in the `/aet/custom` directory.
Before the start of a Karaf service, Docker secrets are exported to environment variables. Read more in [secrets](#docker-secrets) section.
### AET Report 
Runs [Apache Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) that hosts [AET Report](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/SuiteReport).
The [AET report application](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/report) is placed under `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs`.
Defines very basic `VirtualHost` (see [aet.conf](https://github.com/malaskowski/aet-docker/blob/master/report/aet.conf)).
### AET Docker Client
[AET bash client](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/client/client-scripts) embedded into Docker image with all its dependencies (`jq`, `curl`, `xmllint`).

## AET instance with Docker Swarm
This chapter shows how to set up a fully functional AET instance with [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/).
Example single-node AET cluster consists of:
- MongoDB container with a mounted volume (for persistence)
- Selenium Grid with Hub and 3 Nodes (2 Chrome instances each, totally 6 browsers)
- AET ActiveMq container
- AET Browsermob container
- AET Apache Karaf container with AET core installed (Runner, Workers, Web-API, Datastorage, Executor)
- AET Apache Server container with AET Report

> **Notice - this instruction guides you on how to set up AET instance using single-node swarm cluster.** 
> **This setup is not recommended for production use!**

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your host (either ["Docker"](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (e.g. Docker for Windows or Docker for Mac)
- Docker swarm initialized. 
See this [swarm-tutorial: create swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/) for detailed instructions.
  - **TLDR;** run command: `docker swarm init`.
- Make sure your swarm have at least **`4 vCPU` and `8 GB of memory` available**. Read more in [Minimum requirements](#minimum-requirements) section.

#### Minimum requirements
To run example AET instance make sure that machine you run it at has at least enabled:

- `4 vCPU`
- `8 GB of memory`

**How to modify Docker resources**:
- For *Docker for Windows* use [Advanced settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced) (if you are using Docker with WSL2, manage resources via WSL2 settings)
- For *Docker for Mac* use [Advanced settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#advanced)

### Configuration

#### OSGi configs
Thanks to the mounted OSGi configs you may now configure instance via `AET_ROOT/configs` configuration files.

**com.cognifide.aet.cleaner.CleanerScheduler-main.cfg**
Read more [here](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/Cleaner).

**com.cognifide.aet.proxy.RestProxyManager.cfg**
Configures Proxy Server address. AET uses proxy for some features such as collecting status codes or modyfing request's header.
Read more [here](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/SuiteStructure#proxy).

**com.cognifide.aet.queues.DefaultJmsConnection.cfg**
Configures [JMS Server](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/SystemComponents#jms-server) connection.

**com.cognifide.aet.rest.helpers.ReportConfigurationManager.cfg**
Configures address for the Reports module. The `reportDomain` property should point to the externall address of the AET Reports service.

**com.cognifide.aet.runner.MessagesManager.cfg**
Configures JMX endpoint of the [JMS Server](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/SystemComponents#jms-server) for managing messages via API.

**com.cognifide.aet.runner.RunnerConfiguration.cfg**
Configures [AET Runner](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/Runner).

**com.cognifide.aet.vs.mongodb.MongoDBClient.cfg**
Configures [Database](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/DatabaseStructure) connection. Additionally, setting `allowAutoCreate` allows creating new databases by AET (no need to create them manually first, including indexes).

**com.cognifide.aet.worker.drivers.chrome.ChromeWebDriverFactory.cfg**
Configures Selenium Grid Hub address. Additionally enables configuring [capabilities](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/capabilities) via `chromeOptions`.

**com.cognifide.aet.worker.listeners.WorkersListenersService.cfg**
Configures number of [AET Workers](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/Worker). Use those properties to scale up and down your AET instance's throughput. Read more below.
#### Throughput and scaling
AET instance speed depends on the direct number of browsers in the system and its configuration.
Let's define a `TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_BROWSERS` which will be the number of selenium grid node instances
multiplied by `NODE_MAX_SESSION` set for each node. For this default configuration, we have `3`
Selenium Grid instances (`replicas`) with `2` instances of browser available:
```yaml
  chrome:
...
    environment:
...
      - NODE_MAX_SESSION=2
...
    deploy:
      replicas: 3
...
```
So, the `TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_BROWSERS` is `6` (`3 replicas x 2 sessions`).
That number should be set for following configs:
- `maxMessagesInCollectorQueue` in `com.cognifide.aet.runner.RunnerConfiguration.cfg`
- `collectorInstancesNo` in `com.cognifide.aet.worker.listeners.WorkersListenersService.cfg`

#### Docker secrets
AET Karaf image reads all files in the `/run/secrets/` directory matching `KARAF_*` pattern export them as environment variable.
See the [Karaf entrypoint][/blob/master/karaf/entrypoint.sh] for details.

E.g.
If the file `/run/secrets/KARAF_MY_SECRET` is found, its content will be exported to `MY_SECRET` environment variable.

### Updating instance
You may update configuration files directly from your host 
(unless you use docker-machine, see the workaround below).
Karaf should automatically notice changes in the config files.

To update instance to the newer version
1. Update `aet-swarm.yml` and/or configuration files in the `AET_ROOT`.
2. Simply run `docker stack deploy -c aet-swarm.yml aet`

**docker-machine config changes detection workaround**
> Please notice that when you are using docker-machine and Docker Tools, Karaf does not
detect automatic changes in the config. You will need to restart Karaf service after applying
changes in the configuration files (e.g. by removing `aet_karaf` service and running stack deploy).


### Running AET Suite
There are couple of ways to start AET Suite.

#### Docker Client
You may use an image that embeds AET Bash client together with its dependencies by running:

> `docker run --rm malaskowski/aet_client`

This will run a [sample AET Suite](https://github.com/malaskowski/aet-docker/blob/master/client/example.xml).
You should see the results in less than 30s.

To run your custom suite, let's say `my-suite.xml`, located in the current directory, you need to bind mount it as volume.

> `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/my-suite.xml:/aet/suite/my-suite.xml" malaskowski/aet_client http://host.docker.internal:8181 /aet/suite/my-suite.xml`


<details><summary>Read more</summary>
<p>

> The last 2 argumetns are AET Bash client arguments:
> - `http://host.docker.internal:8181` URL of the AET instance,
> - `/aet/suite/my-suite.xml` path to the suite XML file inside the container.
> 
> > Notice that we are using here `host.docker.internal:8181` as the address of AET instance - that works only for Docker for Mac/Win 
> > with local AET setup (this is also the default value for this property). In other cases, use the AET server's IP/domain.
> 
> One more thing you may want to do is to preserve `redirect.html` and `xUnit.xml` files after the AET Client container's run ends its execution. Simply bind mound another volume e.g.:
> 
> `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/my-suite.xml:/aet/suite/my-suite.xml" -v "$(pwd)/report:/aet/report" malaskowski/aet_client http://host.docker.internal:8181 /aet/suite/my-suite.xml`
> 
> The results will be saved to the `report` directory:
> 
> ```
> .
> ├── my-suite.xml
> ├── report
> │   ├── redirect.html
> │   └── xUnit.xml
> ```

</p>
</details>


#### Other Clients
To run AET Suite simply define `endpointDomain` to AET Karaf IP with `8181` port, e.g.:
> `./aet.sh http://localhost:8181`
or
> ` mvn aet:run -DendpointDomain=http://localhost:8181`

Read more about running AET suite [here](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/RunningSuite).

### Best practices
1. Control changes in `aet-swarm.yml` and config files over time! Use version control system 
(e.g. [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)) to keep tracking changes of `AET_ROOT` contents.
2. If you value your data - reports results and history of running suites, remember about 
**backing up MongoDB volume**. If you use external MongoDB, also back up its `/data/db` regularly!
3. Provide at least [minimum requirements](#minimum-requirements) machine for your docker cluster.

### Available consoles
- Selenium grid console: http://localhost:4444/grid/console
- ActiveMQ console: http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp (credentials: `admin/admin`)
- Karaf console: http://localhost:8181/system/console/bundles (credentials: `karaf/karaf`)
- AET Report: `http://localhost/report.html?params...`
> Note, that if you are using *Docker Tools* there will be your docker-machine ip instead of `localhost`

### Troubleshooting
#### Example visualiser
If you want to see what's deployed on your instance, you may use `dockersamples/visualizer` by running:

```
docker service create \
  --name=viz \
  --publish=8090:8080/tcp \
  --constraint=node.role==manager \
  --mount=type=bind,src=/var/run/docker.sock,dst=/var/run/docker.sock \
  dockersamples/visualizer
 ```

- Visualizer console: `http://localhost:8090`
> Note, that if you are using *Docker Tools* there will be your docker-machine ip instead of `localhost`

#### Debugging
To debug bundles on Karaf set environment vairable `KARAF_DEBUG=true` and expose port `5005` on karaf service.

#### Logs
You may preview AET logs with `docker service logs aet_karaf -f`.

## Common issues

### Error response 500 after sending suite to AET
Make sure you have installed all [prerequisites](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/client/client-scripts#prerequisites) for the script client.

---

## FAQ
### How to use external MongoDB
Set the `mongoURI` property in the `configs/com.cognifide.aet.vs.mongodb.MongoDBClient.cfg` to point your mongodb instance uri.

### How to use external Selenium Grid
After you set up external Selenium Grid, update the `seleniumGridUrl` property in the `configs/com.cognifide.aet.worker.drivers.chrome.ChromeWebDriverFactory.cfg` to Grid address.

### How to set report domain
Set `report-domain` property in the `com.cognifide.aet.rest.helpers.ReportConfigurationManager.cfg` to point the domain.

### How to expose AET Web API
[AET Web API](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/WebAPI) is hosed by the AET Karaf instance. 
In order to avoid CORS errors from the Report Application, AET Web API is exposed by the AET Report Apache Server (`ProxyPass`).
By default it is set to work with Docker cluster managers such as Swarm or Kubernetes and points to `http://karaf:8181/api`.
Use `AET_WEB_API` environment variable to change the URL of the AET Web API.

### How to enable AET instance to run more tests simultaneously
> Notice: those changes will impact your machine resources, be sure to extend the number of CPUs and memory
> if you scale up a number of browsers.
1. Spawn more browsers by increasing number of Selenium Grid nodes or adding sessions to existing nodes.
Calculate new [`TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_BROWSERS`](#AET-throughput)
2. Set `maxMessagesInCollectorQueue` in `configs/com.cognifide.aet.runner.RunnerConfiguration.cfg` to new `TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_BROWSERS`.
3. Set `collectorInstancesNo` in `configs/com.cognifide.aet.worker.listeners.WorkersListenersService.cfg` to new `TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_BROWSERS`.
4. Update instance (see [how to do it](#updating-example-instance).

### How to use external Selenium Grid nodes
External Selenium Grid node instance should have:
   * [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed
   * [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) installed
   * [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) (at least version 2.40)
   * [Selenium Standalone Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) (at least version 3.41)

Check the address of the machine, where AET stack is running. By default, Selenium Grid HUB should be
available on the `4444` port. Use this IP address when you run node, with command 
(replace `{SGRID_IP}` with this IP address): 

```bash
java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver="<path/to/chromedriver>" -jar <path/to/selenium-server-standalone.jar> -role node -hub http://{SGRID_IP}:4444/grid/register -browser "browserName=chrome,maxInstances=10" -maxSession 10
```
You should see the message that node joins selenium grid.
Check it via selenium grid console: `http://{SGRID_IP}:4444/grid/console`

Read more about setting up your own Grid here:
- https://selenium.dev/documentation/en/grid/setting_up_your_own_grid/#step-2-start-the-nodes

### Is there other way to run AET than with Docker Swarm cluster
Yes, AET system is a group of containers that form an instance together.
You need a way to organize them and make visible to each other in order to have functional AET instance.
This repository contains **example** instance setup with Docker Swarm, which is the most basic
containers cluster manager that comes OOTB with Docker.
For more advanced setups of AET instance I'd recommend to look at [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) 
or [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) systems (including services provided by cloud vendors).

---

## Building
### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your host.

1. Clone this repository
2. Build all images using `build.sh {tag}`.
You should see following images:
```
    malaskowski/aet_report:{tag}
    malaskowski/aet_karaf:{tag}
    malaskowski/aet_browsermob:{tag}
    malaskowski/aet_activemq:{tag}
```

## Developer environment
In order to be able to easily deploy AET artifacts on your docker instance follow these steps:

1. Follow the [Run local instance using Docker Swarm](#run-local-instance-using-docker-swarm) guide (check the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) first).
2. In the `aet-swarm.yml` under `karaf` and `report` services there are volumes defined:
  ```yaml
    karaf:
      ...
      volumes:
        - ./configs:/aet/custom/configs
        - ./bundles:/aet/custom/bundles
        - ./features:/aet/custom/features
        
     ...
        
     report:
       ...
       # volumes: <- volumes not active by default, to develop the report, uncomment it before deploying
       #  - ./report:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs
  ```
3. In order to add custom extensions, add proper artifacts to the volumes you need.
- bundles (jar files) to the `bundles` directory
- OSGi feature files into the `features`
- `configs` directory already contains default configs
- report files into the `report` directory

To develop [AET application core](https://github.com/wttech/aet), add additional volumes to the `karaf` service:
  ```yaml
    karaf:
      ...
      volumes:
        ...
        - ./core-configs:/aet/core/configs
        - ./core-bundles:/aet/core/bundles
        - ./core-features:/aet/core/features
  ```
and place proper AET artifacts accordingly to the `core-` directories.

> If you use build command with `-Pzip` parameter, all needed artifacts will be placed in `YOUR_AET_REPOSITORY/zip/target/packages-X.X.X-SNAPSHOT/`. You only need to unpack needed zip archives into proper catalogs described in step 3.

4. To start the instance, just run `docker stack deploy -c aet-swarm.yml aet`.
